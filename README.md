### Ear Elevation 

This is the front end for a project called Ear Elevation. It is an app targeted towards musicians to aid in ear training. It provides three musical games. The games will play a musical interval scale or arpeggio that will be correlated with one of the options underneath. The user needs to try and select the correct answer. The users score for the exercises will be tracked and if the user chooses to create an account they will be able to log their exercises so that the information is stored in their profile page.
